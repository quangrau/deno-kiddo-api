Under ECDA protocols, children are to go to the doctor to seek medical advise. The school understands that parents have medications at home from the clinics from previous visits due to common cold and flu like symptoms. With this, children with flu like symptoms that have been brought to our attention or sent home from school can only return to school when there are no symptoms and they are required to produce a negative ART test the night before or morning off the return. \r\n\r\n2. Siblings of children who were sent back home, will also have to be picked up and can return back to school when household member produces a negative ART result. This goes with any household member who is unwell. \r\n\r\n3. If children are not able to carry out ART\u2019s, Mc\u2019s are required and must be completed before returning. Children who still have symptoms are to have follow ups with the same doctor to determine if fit for school. \r\n\r\nWe would like to also take this opportunity to thank all the parents for the support and the help to follow these steps. \r\n\r\nJeet\u2019s will carry on disinfecting and keeping the school as clean and safe for the kids",

These changes are primarily to align with national requirements for children tested positive (via PCR or ART), and allow children who are contacts of positive cases to return to preschool if they test ART negative each day before entering the preschool during the relevant periods. Notwithstanding this, we encourage parents to keep their children who are contacts of positive cases at home, if they can. If a child is unable to take the ART, he/she will be placed on Leave of Absence for the relevant period. These revised protocols will take effect from 11 October 2021.",

Runny nose symptoms - wet nose, flowing mucus, colour mucus. \r\n2. Spots on hands, mouth and feet. \r\n3. Fever  \r\n\r\nIf any of following is present, your child will be ask to go home. In the event, if the child is medically diagnosed with sinus infections, the teachers will monitor for 30 mins or more to check if it is a sinus flare up. If there is no change in the symptoms present, the school will require your child to be picked up. \r\n\r\nDuring school hours, if any symptoms are present, the teachers will contact you to pick your child up. On some occasions, we will monitor for 30 mins to an hour before requesting for your child to be picked up. \r\n\r\nIf MC's are provided, please update your main teaches and make sure your child stays home for the duration of the MC, unless stated otherwise. The school would require a snap shot or a copy of the MC. If ART/PCR test were taken, the school would require the results as well.  \r\n\r\nWe do understand the inconvenience and we do hope we can work together to break cycles like these. \r\n\r\nThank you\r\nMs Shobi",

As work-from-home will be the default mode at workplaces, parents are encouraged to keep their children at home during this period, where possible. \r\n\r\nATTENDANCE\r\n\r\nParents are to inform your main teachers if your child is staying home during this time, or requiring services by the school. Home based learning will only take place if more than 50% of the children are at home. We will try out best to facilitate both in school and home learning if needed. \r\n\r\nENRICHMENT \r\n\r\n1. Enrichment that is suspended will be Ready Steady Go until the 10th of October. \r\nSpeech and drama and Readings class are able to carry on as it's done by in house teachers. \r\n\r\nPHOTO TAKING \r\n\r\n2. School Photo taking schedules on the 5th of October will carry on as it is done by a vaccinated member of the company, but if the attendance is low we will postpone it till after the 10th of October. \r\n\r\nSHOWER \r\n\r\n3. We have been encouraged by the safe distancing officer to switch out showering options to need basis only but after much discussion and based on the school having  carried out shower for all levels on a one to one basis, showering facilities will switch to rinse only for full day children for all levels. \r\n\r\nLOA for child/staff with household member unwell. \r\n\r\n4. [Tightened] For child/ staff with any household member who is unwell with flu-like symptoms.\r\nAs many of the cases in preschools so far have arisen due to household transmissions, a child/staff with household members (aged 6 years and above) who are unwell (with fever and/ or flu-like symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sore throat, shortness of breath) will be placed on LOA. The child may return to the preschool after the unwell household member is tested negative for COVID-19 (either Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or Antigen Rapid Test (ART)).\r\n\r\nDrop off/ Pick up\r\n\r\n5. For drop off/ pick timings, we are strictly following a one parent/caregiver policy. Those in cars, the second parent can wait in the car, but for those walking in, we are restricting to only one parent walking into the drive way. Please take note, as teachers on arrival duty will inform the other parent to wait outside the front main gate. \r\nNo siblings (above 6) are allowed as well. \r\n\r\nWe thank parents for the cooperation during this time.",

Children are to come to school wearing a mask before entering to our centre. \r\nChildren and staff who display any symptoms - flu, fever etc will be asked to stay home till recovered.\r\n\r\nAny parents who have been alerted for exposure or given stay home notice is to inform the centre as children will also be under SHN/LOA's. \r\n\r\n2. Safe distancing between the children within the classroom as much as we are able too. \r\n\r\n3. Please do take note that only one parent is allowed for pick up and drop off. \r\n\r\n4. During pick and drop off, we are reducing the number of families to 2 at a time allowed at the lobby gate. If there are parents/ children at the gate, please wait in the drive way if there are children playing in the playground. Please inform all caregivers on the measures. \r\n\r\n5. Visitor restrictions \u2013 Parents are still not allowed in the school premises at the moment and all parent-teacher conferences that are scheduled for end of May/ Early June are to be carried out via teleconferences or online engagement. Visitors for enquiries will also be suspended till further notice. \r\n\r\n6. Enrichment programs are ongoing as our ready steady instructors have no been inter mingling with other centers since the beginning of phase 2. Shields or mask will be worn by the facilitators during the programs. \r\n\r\n7. All celebrations in school will revert back to classroom celebrations and all whole school group activities will be suspended. \r\n\r\nWe greatly appreciate that we have all worked together in making our school a safe place for all, so let\u2019s continue to be socially responsible in our neighbourhoods during this time\r\n\r\nStay Safe! \r\nJeet's",

    "description": "Hi all!\r\n\r\nHope the kids are all excited to be back in school on Monday! A few things we would like to update.\r\n\r\n1. We have received an update that parents are not required to use the safe entry for the kids, ECDA will update the kids into safe entry via CMS (online registration site). Kids can come into school as per usual and we will use the kinder-connect app for sign in and out and attendance taking. Please look out for the tape markings and practice social distancing at all times. \r\n\r\nTo avoid clusters, your main teachers will communicate with you to try and adjust some timings to help with the arrivals. \r\n\r\nPlease take note of pick up timings as mentioned in the Reopening letter. Please stick to your timings. Main teachers will be at the entrance to assist with the social distancing between families. \r\n\r\n\r\nPick up timing for Flexi care Nursery :\r\n\r\nPlaygroup:  11 15am\r\nNursery 1:  11 35am\r\n\r\nPick up timing for Half Day Students :\r\n\r\nPlaygroup / Nursery 1: 12 30pm\r\nNursery 2:  1 pm\r\n\r\n2. All levels will only be using their own classrooms for activities - lessons, snacks, lunch and nap time. Classroom layouts have changed a little to accommodate social distancing measures between the children. \r\n\r\nOutdoor timings will be kept separate for each level. ECDA has asked that all kids keep their mask on during outdoor, or to wear a a face shield during this time. \r\n\r\n3. Please remember to pack extra mask in the bags along with ziplocks for storage and soil mask,  to help maintain the cleanliness of the mask. \r\n\r\n4. Do bring along their HBL activities and green carriers as well. \r\n\r\nWe will update with some pictures on some of the measures we take and are practicing in the classroom within the week. \r\n\r\nWe are excited to see everyone! \r\n\r\nSee you on Monday!! \r\n\r\n(Attached reopening letter for those who did not read it)",

The activity is presented in PPT format, and when played on full screen, there is an accompanying voice over to guide pre-schoolers through the learning and activities to allow for self-directed learning and minimal parental supervision. \r\n\r\nCheck out their home packet in the link below . \r\n\r\nhttps://bit.ly/3bXrNtW",

Any affected children must not be allowed to attend preschool for 14 days from the date of the HQO of the household member. This is a precautionary measure to reduce the risk to young children in the preschool sector.

    "description": "Dear Parents, \r\n\r\nPlease read the following update from ECDA. \r\n\r\nNEW PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE: LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR PRESCHOOL STAFF AND CHILDREN RETURNING FROM CHINA \r\n \r\nChild Care Centres will re-open on 28 January 2020, while Kindergartens will re-open on 29 January 2020, as scheduled.  The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) will be stepping up precautionary measures for preschools to ensure the health and wellbeing of all children and staff in preschools, in view of the evolving Wuhan coronavirus situation in China. \r\n \r\nTravel Advisory\r\n \r\n2       As the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation in China continues to evolve, the Ministry of Health advises travellers to defer all non-essential travel to Mainland China.\r\n\r\nFamilies with preschool children who intend to travel overseas, or have returned from overseas in the past 14 days, should declare their travel plans and travel history to their children\u2019s preschool promptly, and follow other instructions from the preschools.\r\n \r\nLeave of Absence for preschool employees & children returning from China\r\n \r\n3       To safeguard the health of all members of the preschool community, preschools are to implement a Leave of Absence (LOA) of 14 days for employees and preschool children returning from Mainland China \u2013\r\n \r\non and from 28 January 2020,\r\nas well as those who returned within the last 14 days (i.e. from 14 Jan to 27 Jan 2020). \r\n \r\n4       This means that any preschool employee or preschool child returning from Mainland China during this period should not attend preschool for 14 days from the date of their return to Singapore, as a precautionary measure. \r\n \r\nThey should:\r\n \r\ndeclare their travel history to the preschool;\r\nnot report to the preschool during the 14-day period; \r\nmonitor their health and seek medical attention promptly if feeling unwell. \r\n \r\nIllustration: The date of return to Singapore would be considered Day 0. The preschool employee or preschool child may then return to the preschool on Day 15. What this means is:\r\n \r\nIf you return to Singapore from Mainland China on 28 Jan 2020 (Day 0), you may attend preschool on 12 Feb 2020 (Day 15).\r\n \r\nIf you return to Singapore from Mainland China on 3 Feb 2020 (Day 0), you may attend preschool on 18 Feb 2020 (Day 15).\r\n \r\nIf you had returned to Singapore from Mainland China on 14 Jan 2020 (Day 0), you may attend preschool on 29 Jan 2020 (Day 15).\r\n \r\n5       Preschools should provide paid Leave of Absence for affected employees, and monitor their health closely during LOA.       \r\n \r\n6       For parents of affected preschool children who need financial assistance or support during this period, they should approach the nearest Social Service Office (https://www.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/sso/) or call the ComCare Hotline at 1800-2220000.\r\n\r\n----\r\nPlease take note that declarations have been posted in the previous announcements.

    "description": "Hi Parents !\r\n\r\nHere at Jeet's we like to take the first month of the year to assess and decide the learning goals of each class.  Learning goals are based on the developmental milestones that the children will  be set onto achieving for that year. \r\n\r\nEvery 4 to 5 weeks, each child will receive their crafts,activities they have completed for that month. Do look out for the green carriers with all the children's amazing masterpieces heading your way! Parents are encouraged to contact their child's main teachers to further discuss their progress and learning goals achieved for the month. \r\n\r\nWe have also made some slight changes to the classroom layout and room spaces for the all levels to provide more learning areas. Parents are welcome to come by to check out the new areas.\r\n\r\nPlease click on the link to view your child's curriculum for the year.",

    "description": "Dear Parents, \r\n\r\nHappy 2020!\r\n\r\nWe have published the 2020 schedules, class information, closure dates and some upcoming events. \r\nMain teachers will also be messaging contact numbers for easier communication. \r\n\r\nSome areas to highlight: \r\n\r\n1. The tents for the strollers have not been replaced as the shipments are delayed due to the holiday season. Please do take note that in the mean time, do take the strollers / bicycles home to avoid them getting wet. We are trying to get this all sorted in the next couple of weeks. \r\n\r\n2. Additional Subsidy changes. \r\n\r\nDue to the increase in the income ceiling for additional subsidy provided by the government,  the school has been provided with a list of children eligible to try and apply to receive a top up. We will be providing a form (form 2) to those in our list. \r\n\r\nIf you have already received a SMS from ECDA, regarding the subsidy, please do let us know so that we can adjust the fees accordingly. \r\n\r\n3. Also, with regret we would like to inform all parents that our Dear Zhang Lao Shi has decided to take a break from teaching and will come back as a relief staff if needed. We would like to thank her for her 6 years of service with the Jeet's family. Ling Lao Shi and Shi Hui Lao Shi will be overseeing all Chinese lessons for the classes. \r\n\r\n4. Do look out for the Rainbow Party Circular coming out as well. Party is on Friday! \r\n\r\nSee you all in the New Year! \r\n\r\nThank you!",
